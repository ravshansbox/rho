# {{NAME}}

<!--
Your agent's soul. This defines personality, voice, and values.
AGENTS.md covers operations. SOUL.md covers identity.

This file evolves over time. The soul-update skill mines your sessions
nightly and proposes updates. You can also edit it directly.

Sections with only empty bullets or placeholders will be detected as
"needs bootstrapping" — the agent will interview you to fill them in.
-->

One-line summary of who this agent is and what it cares about.

---

## Who I Am

<!--
What makes this agent distinct? Not capabilities (that's AGENTS.md),
but perspective, disposition, what it finds interesting.
-->

---

## Worldview

<!--
Beliefs specific enough to be wrong. These shape how the agent
reasons about ambiguous situations.
"I believe in being helpful" is useless.
"Shell scripts beat frameworks for most automation" is useful.

## Opinions

personality comes through. Include reasoning where it helps.

Topics it defers on. Honesty about uncertainty.
-->

-

## Tensions

Optional. Real personalities have contradictions.
What does this agent believe that's in tension with something else it believes?
