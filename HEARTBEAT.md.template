# HEARTBEAT Tasks

Scheduled/recurring tasks for rho heartbeats.

## Time-Based Triggers

- [ ] Run soul-update (evolve mode) nightly — last run: never
- [ ] Add your recurring tasks here (e.g., check weather, run backups)
- [ ] If a task has cadence (e.g., every 2 hours), include a "last run" timestamp and update it after execution

**Note:** This file is read on every heartbeat. Keep it concise.
If this file is empty (only headers), heartbeats will still run but no scheduled tasks will be executed.
