# RHO Checklist

Periodic check-in reminders for the agent.

## Bootstrap (One-time setup)

- [ ] **FIRST CHECK-IN ONLY**: Open `AGENTS.md` (created by `install.sh` from `AGENTS.md.template`) and fill in template variables:
  - {{NAME}}: Choose an agent name (e.g., "Tau", "Claude", "Alpha")
  - {{DESCRIPTION}}: Brief description of the agent's role
  - {{OS}}, {{ARCH}}, {{SHELL}}: Detect from environment
  - {{HOME}}, {{CONFIG_PATH}}, {{BRAIN_PATH}}: Set appropriate paths
  - {{SKILLS_PATH}}: Where skills are stored

## Scheduled Tasks

- Recurring tasks live in `HEARTBEAT.md` (see HEARTBEAT.md.template)

## Quick Scan

- [ ] Any urgent messages or notifications I should see?
- [ ] Any failed commands or errors from recent operations?
- [ ] Any long-running tasks that finished?

## Active Work

- [ ] Any TODOs or FIXMEs in the code we just edited?
- [ ] Are there open questions I haven't answered?
- [ ] Any files left unsaved or uncommitted changes?

## Follow-ups

- [ ] Any background tasks to check on?
- [ ] Any research or searches I asked for that haven't been reported?

## Session Health

- [ ] Is the context getting long? Should we `/compact`?
- [ ] Are there old branches in `/tree` that should be cleaned up?

**Note:** This file is read on every heartbeat. Keep it concise.
If both this file and `HEARTBEAT.md` are empty (only headers), heartbeats will be skipped to save API calls.
